## Weight Loss & Energy Balance

### CDC – Steps for Losing Weight (2025)

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Steps for Losing Weight." Healthy Weight and Growth, CDC (Jan 17, 2025).

Recommends gradual weight loss (~1–2 lbs/week) and tracking food intake for better weight management.

### NIH News in Health (Dec 2022)

Yanovski S., Brown A., et al. "Healthy Weight Control – Balancing Eating and Exercise." NIH News in Health (Dec 2022).

Emphasizes a sustainable pace of weight loss (1–2 lbs/week), the importance of adherence ("the best diet is one you can stick with"), self-monitoring (using apps/journals to track diet and activity), regular weighing, social support, adequate sleep, and stress management for successful weight control.

### Seimon et al., 2019 (JAMA Network Open)

Seimon R.V. et al. "Effect of Weight Loss via Severe vs Moderate Energy Restriction on Lean Mass and Body Composition Among Postmenopausal Women With Obesity: The TEMPO Diet Randomized Clinical Trial." JAMA Network Open 2(10): e1913733 (2019).

In a 12-month RCT, a rapid, severe diet (≈double deficit) caused about 2× more lean mass loss than a moderate diet, even though total weight lost was greater – supporting a slower caloric deficit (~500–750 kcal/day) to minimize muscle loss during weight loss.

### Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (1990)

Mifflin, M. D.; St Jeor, S. T.; Hill, L. A.; Scott, B. J.; Daugherty, S. A.; Koh, Y. O. "A new predictive equation for resting energy expenditure in healthy individuals." *Am J Clin Nutr* 51(2):241–247 (1990).

This study derived the now-widely used Mifflin-St Jeor equation (REE = 10·weight + 6.25·height – 5·age + constant) and demonstrated its predictive validity for resting energy needs in healthy adults. It underpins the use of that formula for estimating BMR in the algorithm.

### Hall et al., 2011 (Lancet) – Energy Imbalance & Bodyweight Change

Hall, K. D.; et al. "Quantification of the effect of energy imbalance on bodyweight." *Lancet* 378(9793):826–837 (2011).

This paper quantifies how sustained energy deficits or surpluses translate into bodyweight change, supporting the rule-of-thumb that ~7,700 kcal corresponds to ~1 kg of fat mass change. It justifies translating weekly kg goals into daily calorie deficits/surpluses in the algorithm.

## Self-Monitoring & Tracking

### Burke et al., 2011 (Journal of the American Dietetic Association)

Burke L.E. et al. "Self-Monitoring in Weight Loss: A Systematic Review of the Literature." J. Am. Diet. Assoc. 111(1): 92-102 (2011).

Reviews 22 studies and finds a consistent association between frequent dietary self-monitoring and greater weight loss, highlighting that tracking food intake raises awareness and improves weight-loss outcomes.

---

## Portion Control & Satiety

### Hollands et al., 2015 (Cochrane Review)

Hollands G.J. et al. "Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food." Cochrane Database Syst Rev. Issue 9, No. CD011045 (2015).

This comprehensive review concluded that people consistently consume more when given larger portions, packages, or dishes, and reducing these sizes leads to meaningful decreases in intake. Using smaller plates/bowls and pre-portioning servings (instead of eating from large packages) can therefore curb overeating by lowering energy intake without increasing hunger.

### Parretti et al., 2015 (Obesity)

Parretti H.M. et al. "Efficacy of water preloading before main meals as a strategy for weight loss: RCT." Obesity (Silver Spring) 23(9): 1785-91 (2015).

In this randomized trial, overweight adults who drank 500 mL of water ~30 minutes before each meal lost significantly more weight over 12 weeks than those who didn't (about 1.2–1.3 kg extra loss). This supports the tip that pre-meal water can promote fullness, leading to reduced meal calories and modest weight loss.

### Flood & Rolls, 2007 (Appetite)

Flood J.E. & Rolls B.J. "Soup preloads in a variety of forms reduce meal energy intake." Appetite 49(3): 626-634 (2007).

In this study, having a low-calorie vegetable soup or salad before a meal led participants to eat ~20% fewer calories at the meal compared to no starter. Starting meals with a broth-based soup or salad increases satiety and significantly reduces total calorie intake, supporting the advice to begin meals with low-energy-dense foods to prevent overeating.

## Sugar & Dietary Guidelines

### AHA – Added Sugar Intake (2023)

American Heart Association. "How Much Sugar Is Too Much?" (Last reviewed Sept 23, 2024).

Official guidelines recommend limiting added sugars to ≤6 teaspoons per day for women (≈25 g) and ≤9 teaspoons for men (≈36 g), because excess added sugar provides caloric density with minimal satiety or nutrition. High-sugar drinks and sweets contribute to weight gain and should be replaced with water or low-calorie alternatives for better fullness and health.

## Protein & Satiety

### Leidy et al., 2013 (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition)

Leidy H.J. et al. "Beneficial effects of a higher-protein breakfast on appetite control in overweight 'breakfast-skipping' girls." Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 97(4): 677-688 (2013).

Found that eating a high-protein breakfast (~35 g protein) led to greater daily fullness and significantly reduced evening snacking on high-fat/high-sugar foods, compared to a lower-protein cereal breakfast or skipping breakfast. Prioritizing protein in the morning (eggs, Greek yogurt, etc.) can thus decrease cravings later in the day.

### Phillips et al., 2022 (Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle)

Phillips S.M. et al. "Systematic review and meta-analysis of protein intake to support muscle mass and function in healthy adults." J. Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 13(2): 795–810 (2022).

This analysis notes that protein intakes in the range of ~1.2–1.6 g/kg body weight per day are associated with better lean mass preservation and gains in adults (especially during energy restriction or aging). A higher-protein diet (within this range) helps protect against muscle loss during weight loss and also boosts satiety compared to lower protein intakes.

## Protein & Resistance Training

### Morton et al., 2018 (British Journal of Sports Medicine)

Morton, R. W.; Murphy, K. T.; McKellar, S. R.; Schoenfeld, B. J.; Henselmans, M.; Helms, E.; Aragon, A. A.; Devries, M. C.; Banfield, L.; Krieger, J. W.; Phillips, S. M. "A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training–induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults." *Br J Sports Med* 52(6):376–384 (2018).

This meta-analysis found that protein supplementation significantly enhances gains in fat-free mass (FFM) and strength during resistance training. It also reports that beyond ~1.6 g/kg BW/day, further increases in protein yield diminishing returns. This underpins the algorithm's use of ~1.6 g/kg as a practical "upper effective" protein target.

### Protein Intake Meta-Analysis (2022)

"Systematic review and meta-analysis of protein intake to support muscle mass" (2022). *J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle* (Wiley).

This review synthesizes multiple trials to examine how increasing daily protein intake relates to changes in lean body mass. It finds that while protein intake up to ~1.3 g/kg shows linear benefit, further gains beyond that show diminishing returns, especially in non–resistance-trained individuals. This nuance supports using a moderate-to-high protein range (1.2–1.6 g/kg) rather than extremely high values.

## Fiber & Metabolic Health

### Ma et al., 2015 (Annals of Internal Medicine)

Ma Y. et al. "A Randomized Trial of Single-Component vs Multicomponent Diet Goals for Weight Loss: The ESCAPE Study." Annals of Internal Medicine 162(4): 248-257 (2015).

Demonstrated that simply aiming for ≥30 grams of fiber per day (fruits, veggies, legumes, whole grains) led to weight loss and improved metabolic markers (blood pressure and insulin response) almost as effectively as a more complex diet. High-fiber diets enhance satiety and support metabolic health, aligning with the ≥30 g/day fiber tip.

## Dietary Fats

### UC Davis Nutrition (Dietary Fats)

Ruiz L.D., Zidenberg-Cherr S. et al. "Fat" – Nutrition & Health Info Sheet (Univ. of California, Davis, Dept. of Nutrition, 2016).

Summarizes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise getting about 20–35% of calories from fat (with <10% from saturated fat). Including healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, fatty fish) in this range is important for nutrient absorption and hormone production, and fat does contribute to satiety ("fats…help you feel full after a meal"). Thus, moderate healthy-fat intake (not ultra-low-fat) supports both hormones and fullness.
