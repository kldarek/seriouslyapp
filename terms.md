# Seriously — Terms of Service

**Last updated:** August 9, 2025

Welcome to Seriously! These Terms govern your use of the App, which is built and maintained by a **private individual** (not a company). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree, do not use the App.

> **No Medical Advice:** Seriously provides **general wellness** information only. It does not diagnose, treat, or provide medical advice. Always consult a qualified professional for health decisions.

---

## Eligibility

You must be **16 years or older** to use the App. If you are a minor in your jurisdiction, review these Terms with a parent/guardian.

---

## Description of the Service

Seriously offers AI‑assisted nutrition guidance, food/meal logging, calorie/macronutrient tracking, progress logs, and educational content. Nutritional databases and AI outputs can be incomplete or approximate. Use your own judgment and verify important information.

The Service may change over time (features may be added, modified, or removed). The App is provided **“as is” and “as available.”** Availability and error‑free operation are **not** guaranteed. As a personal side project maintained by one individual, **support and updates are provided on a best‑effort basis** and may be delayed or unavailable.

---

## Availability & Support

Seriously is a personal side project run by one individual. I may modify, suspend, or discontinue all or part of the App **at any time without notice**. I do not promise any specific level of availability, response times, data retention, or support.

---

## Accounts & Security

You may sign in via Apple or Google. Keep your credentials secure and your account information up to date. You’re responsible for activities under your account. If you suspect unauthorized access, contact **[seriously.ai@gmail.com](mailto\:seriously.ai@gmail.com)** immediately.

---

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Break laws or infringe rights.
- Harass, threaten, or post unlawful/obscene content.
- Seek medical/clinical use or represent the App as a medical device.
- Impersonate others or engage in fraud.
- Reverse engineer, probe, or attack the App’s security.
- Automate scraping or abuse the service.
- Upload content you don’t have rights to.

I do **not** undertake to monitor user content, but I may remove content or suspend accounts at my discretion to protect users or comply with law. Violations may result in content removal and account suspension/termination.

---

## User Content & AI Content

- **Your content** (diet logs, queries, etc.) remains yours. You grant a limited, revocable, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to process it to provide/improve the Service.
- **AI responses** may be inaccurate or inappropriate. Use at your own risk. Report problematic outputs via email.

---

## Subscriptions & Purchases (if offered)

Purchases use **Apple’s in‑app purchase** system. Apple bills your Apple ID; manage/cancel in your Apple ID settings. I don’t see your card details. RevenueCat helps verify subscription status. Trials, renewals, price changes, and refunds are handled per Apple policies. If payment fails, access to Premium may be suspended.

---

## Termination

You can stop using the App anytime. You may request account deletion via **[seriously.ai@gmail.com](mailto\:seriously.ai@gmail.com)** (or via any in‑app deletion feature). I may suspend or terminate access for violations, legal requirements, discontinuation, or long‑term inactivity. If terminated for breach, refunds may not be available.

---

## Intellectual Property

Except for your content, the App, code, designs, and materials are owned by the developer or licensors. You receive a personal, non‑transferable, revocable license to use the App. Don’t copy, modify, or create derivative works without permission.

---

## Third‑Party Services

Links or integrations (e.g., Apple Health, articles) are governed by third‑party terms. I’m not responsible for their content or practices.

---

## Disclaimers

The App is provided **“AS IS”** and **“AS AVAILABLE.”** To the fullest extent permitted by law, I disclaim all warranties (express, implied, or statutory), including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non‑infringement. I do not warrant that the App or AI outputs will be accurate, reliable, uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free, or that defects will be corrected.

**No Professional/Medical Advice.** The App provides **general wellness** information only and is **not** a substitute for professional medical, nutrition, or health advice. The App is **not a medical device**. Do not use it for diagnosis, treatment, or emergencies. Always consult a qualified professional before making significant dietary changes.

**Data Loss & Backups.** You are responsible for backing up your data. I do not promise that content will be stored or retrievable.

---

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer and service providers will **not** be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; loss of profits, revenues, goodwill, or data; or personal injury arising out of or relating to your use of (or inability to use) the App or any AI outputs.

**Aggregate cap.** For paid users, total liability for all claims in any 12‑month period will not exceed the amounts you paid for Premium during that period; if you paid nothing, the cap is **€0**.

Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law, including liability for **wilful misconduct** or **gross negligence**.

---

## Indemnification

To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer from third‑party claims and costs (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your misuse of the App, violation of these Terms, or infringement of others’ rights.

---

## Changes to the Service or Terms

I may update the App and these Terms at any time. Where required by law, I will provide notice in‑app or by email. Continued use after changes take effect means you accept the changes.

---

## Consumer Rights

Nothing in these Terms affects your **non‑waivable statutory rights** under applicable law (including EU and Polish consumer protection law).

---

## Force Majeure

I will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform due to causes beyond my reasonable control (e.g., internet outages, platform changes, strikes, acts of government, disasters, or war).

---

## Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remainder will continue in effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.

---

## Governing Law & Disputes

These Terms are governed by **Polish law** (subject to any mandatory EU consumer protections). Disputes will be resolved by competent courts in Poland, or your home EU country where required by law. You may also use the EU ODR platform if applicable.
