                            <h3>Dr. Maya's Story</h3>
                            <p>Dr. Maya spent years in virtual laboratories studying the intricate dance of macronutrients, micronutrients, and metabolism. But unlike dry textbook knowledge, Maya has a gift for translating complex nutritional science into "aha!" moments that actually stick.</p>
                            
                            <p>Maya's passion lies in debunking nutrition myths with kindness and evidence. "Did you know that eating carbs at night doesn't automatically make them turn into fat?" Maya will explain, complete with easy-to-understand analogies and real-world examples that make you go "Oh, that makes total sense!"</p>
                            
                            <p>What sets Maya apart is her ability to make you feel smart about nutrition rather than confused. She celebrates your curiosity and never makes you feel silly for asking questions—even if it's "Is putting butter in coffee actually healthy?" (She has thoughts on that, by the way.)</p>
