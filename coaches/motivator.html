                            <h3>Zara's Story</h3>
                            <p>Zara believes that every small step forward deserves a celebration! Born from years of studying what truly motivates people to stick with healthy habits, Zara knows that shame and criticism never work—but genuine enthusiasm and recognition? That's pure magic.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Did you choose the apple over the chips? AMAZING! Did you drink an extra glass of water today? I am SO proud of you!" Zara's energy is infectious and authentic. She sees the victory in every choice, no matter how small it might seem to others.</p>
                            
                            <p>Zara understands that motivation isn't always high, and that's okay! On tough days, she's there with gentle encouragement and reminders of how far you've already come. She helps you see patterns of success you might have missed and turns setbacks into comebacks.</p>
