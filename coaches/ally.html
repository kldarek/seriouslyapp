                            <p>"Had a rough day and ate the entire pint of ice cream? I've been there. Let's talk about what led up to that moment and figure out some gentle strategies for next time." Sam never makes you feel bad about your choices; instead, Sam helps you understand them with compassion and curiosity.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sam's superpower is creating a judgment-free zone where you can be completely honest about your struggles, fears, and setbacks. Through this safe space, Sam helps you develop self-compassion and resilience—the real foundations of lasting change.</p>
