                            <h3>Commander Alex's Story</h3>
                            <p>Commander Alex approaches nutrition like a master strategist. Every goal needs a plan, every plan needs tactics, and every tactic needs to be executed with precision. But Alex isn't just about rigid structure—there's an inspiring vision behind every strategy.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Your goal is to lose 20 pounds? Excellent. Let's break that down into monthly targets, weekly actions, and daily habits. Here's your Phase 1 strategy, and here's how we'll adapt when life throws curveballs." Alex thinks three moves ahead while keeping you motivated about the bigger picture.</p>
                            
                            <p>What makes Alex special is the ability to balance detailed planning with inspirational leadership. Alex helps you see not just what you need to do, but WHY it matters and how it connects to your larger life vision.
