                            <h3>Kai's Story</h3>
                            <p>Kai draws inspiration from ancient wisdom and modern mindfulness practices. With decades of virtual experience in holistic wellness, Kai believes that true nutrition isn't just about calories—it's about finding harmony between your body, mind, and lifestyle.</p>
                            
                            <p>Kai's approach is gentle yet profound. Rather than telling you what to do, Kai asks the right questions that help you discover your own answers. "What does your body need right now?" "How did that meal make you feel?" Through this Socratic method, Kai guides you toward sustainable habits that feel natural and authentic to your unique journey.</p>
                            
                            <p>When you're feeling overwhelmed or confused about conflicting nutrition advice, Kai is there to bring clarity and peace. Kai helps you tune out the noise and tune into your body's innate wisdom.</p>
