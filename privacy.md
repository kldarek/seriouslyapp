# Seriously — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** August 9, 2025

Seriously (the "App") is an iOS mobile app that provides AI‑powered diet coaching, calorie tracking, and nutrition tips. I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information I collect, how it's used and shared, and your rights.

> **Important:** Seriously is a general wellness app. It does **not** provide medical or healthcare advice or treatment. See the **Health Disclaimer** in the Terms of Service.

## Data Controller and Contact

The data controller is the **individual developer of Seriously (EU‑based private person)**. For all privacy and support matters, contact: **[seriouslyapp.com@gmail.com](mailto\:seriouslyapp.com@gmail.com)**.

---

## Information I Collect

- **Account Information.** If you sign in with Apple or Google, I receive identifiers from those providers (e.g., name, email). I do **not** receive your passwords.
- **Profile & Wellness Data.** Age, weight, height, dietary preferences or restrictions, calorie targets, and similar wellness details you choose to enter. Some entries may be considered **health‑related data**; they’re processed only with your explicit consent, which you give when entering them in the App.
- **AI Chat Inputs.** The questions and messages you submit to the AI coach. Avoid sharing highly sensitive data.
- **App & Device Data.** Logs about feature usage and basic device data (model, OS version, app version, and identifiers needed for functionality/troubleshooting).
- **Subscription Data (if applicable).** If you subscribe to Premium features, I receive confirmation of your purchase, plan, and renewal status via Apple’s in‑app purchase system with the help of RevenueCat. I do **not** receive or store payment card details.

I collect **only what’s needed** to provide and improve the App.

---

## How Your Information Is Used

- **Provide & Personalize the Service.** Use profile/goals/chat inputs to tailor coaching and tracking features.
- **AI‑Powered Responses.** Your chat inputs are sent securely to AI providers **(OpenAI and/or Google)** to generate responses.
- **Account & Support.** Authenticate your login (Apple/Google), send critical service updates, and respond to support.
- **Subscription Management (if used).** Verify subscription status (via RevenueCat) and unlock Premium features.
- **Improve & Secure the App.** Analyze aggregated usage (de‑identified where possible), fix bugs, and prevent abuse or fraud.
- **Legal Compliance.** Comply with lawful requests and tax/transaction record‑keeping where applicable.

I will not use your data for purposes that are incompatible with the above without informing you and obtaining any required consent.

---

## Legal Bases (GDPR)

- **Contract.** Most processing is necessary to provide the App you requested.
- **Consent.** Special‑category (health‑related) data and marketing emails rely on your explicit consent; you can withdraw consent at any time.
- **Legitimate Interests.** Improve the App, prevent fraud/abuse, and ensure security—balanced against your rights.
- **Legal Obligation.** Where laws require record‑keeping or disclosures.

---

## AI and Third‑Party Processors

To power features, I use a small number of service providers acting on my instructions as **processors**. I share only what’s necessary to provide the App, I do **not** sell your data, and I do **not** use advertising/behavioral tracking SDKs.

- **AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google).** Your prompts (and minimal context) are sent to generate a reply. I do not include your direct contact details in prompts. Processing is subject to each provider’s terms; I do not control their systems.
- **RevenueCat (subscriptions, if used).** Processes purchase receipts from Apple to determine subscription status. I do not receive your payment card details.
- **Apple / Google (auth & app stores).** Governed by their terms when you sign in or purchase.

Data may be processed in or transferred to countries outside the EU. Where this happens, I rely on appropriate safeguards and protect data in transit and at rest.

I **do not** use third‑party data for advertising or profiling, and I avoid collecting more data than necessary to operate the App.

---

## Data Sharing

- **With your direction/consent.** For future optional integrations you explicitly enable.
- **Legal requests.** Only what’s required and, if allowed, I’ll notify you.
- **Protection of rights & safety.** To enforce terms and protect users.

---

## Retention

- **Account data** is kept while your account is active. Upon deletion or prolonged inactivity, it’s deleted or anonymized (subject to brief backup retention).
- **Wellness entries & chat logs.** Kept so the App works (e.g., showing your history) and deleted on account deletion or upon your request. Not used for third‑party advertising.
- **Subscription records** are kept while needed for service and legal obligations.

---

## Your Rights (GDPR)

You can request **access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability,** and **objection** (including to marketing). You can withdraw consent at any time. To exercise rights, email **[seriouslyapp.com@gmail.com](mailto\:seriouslyapp.com@gmail.com)**. I may need to verify your identity. You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.

---

## Automated Decision‑Making

I do **not** engage in automated decision‑making that produces legal or similarly significant effects about you.

---

## Security

TLS encryption in transit, encryption at rest, access controls, least‑privilege, logging, and routine updates/monitoring. No system is 100% secure, but I take appropriate measures. If a breach affecting your data occurs, I’ll notify you and authorities as required.

---

## Children

The App is for users **16+**. I do not knowingly process data of children under 16. If you believe a child’s data was provided, contact me for deletion.

---

## International Transfers

Where data is processed outside the EU, I rely on legally appropriate safeguards and technical/organizational measures to protect your data.

---

## Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy. Material changes will be notified in‑app or via email. Continued use after the effective date signifies acceptance.
