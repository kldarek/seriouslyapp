# Seriously — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** August 9, 2025

Seriously (the "App") is an iOS mobile app that provides AI‑powered diet coaching, calorie tracking, and nutrition tips. I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information I collect, how it's used and shared, and your rights.

> **Important:** Seriously is a general wellness app. It does **not** provide medical or healthcare advice or treatment. See the **Health Disclaimer** in the Terms of Service.

## Data Controller and Contact

The data controller is the **individual developer of Seriously (EU‑based private person)**. For all privacy and support matters, contact: **[seriouslyapp.com@gmail.com](mailto\:seriouslyapp.com@gmail.com)**.

## Information I Collect

- **Account Information.** If you sign in with Apple or Google, I receive identifiers from those providers (e.g., name, email). I do **not** receive your passwords.
- **Profile & Wellness Data.** Age, weight, height, dietary preferences or restrictions, calorie targets, and similar wellness details you choose to enter. Some entries may be considered **health‑related data**; they're processed only with your explicit consent, which you give when entering them in the App.
- **Food Photos & Images.** Photos of meals and food you upload for calorie tracking and AI analysis. These images may contain visual information about your food, meals, dining environment, and occasionally metadata (e.g., time, location if enabled on your device).
- **AI Chat Inputs.** The questions and messages you submit to the AI coach. Avoid sharing highly sensitive data.
- **App & Device Data.** Logs about feature usage and basic device data (model, OS version, app version, and identifiers needed for functionality/troubleshooting).
- **Subscription & Payment Data.** If you subscribe to Premium features:
  - **Purchase Information:** I receive confirmation of your purchase, subscription plan, renewal status, and purchase date via Apple's in-app purchase system through RevenueCat
  - **Transaction Records:** Apple transaction IDs, receipt data, and subscription status for verification and customer support
  - **Billing Information:** I do **not** receive, process, or store payment card details, billing addresses, or financial information - all payment processing is handled securely by Apple
  - **Purchase History:** Records of subscription start dates, renewals, cancellations, and refunds for customer support and legal compliance

I collect **only what's needed** to provide and improve the App.

## How Your Information Is Used

- **Provide & Personalize the Service.** Use profile/goals/chat inputs to tailor coaching and tracking features.
- **AI‑Powered Responses.** Your chat inputs are sent securely to AI providers **(OpenAI and/or Google)** to generate responses.
- **Food Photo Analysis.** Uploaded food photos are analyzed using AI to detect food items, estimate calories, and identify macronutrients.
- **AI Model Training & Improvement.** Food photos and related data (in anonymized/de-identified form) are used to train and improve AI calorie detection, food recognition, and nutrition estimation models. This helps make the App more accurate and beneficial for all users. Your identity is removed before data is used for training.
- **Account & Support.** Authenticate your login (Apple/Google), send critical service updates, and respond to support.
- **Subscription & Payment Processing.** Verify subscription status, process renewals, handle subscription changes, manage access to Premium features, and maintain transaction records for customer support and legal compliance (via RevenueCat and Apple's systems).
- **Improve & Secure the App.** Analyze aggregated usage (de‑identified where possible), fix bugs, and prevent abuse or fraud.
- **Legal Compliance.** Comply with lawful requests and tax/transaction record‑keeping where applicable.

I will not use your data for purposes that are incompatible with the above without informing you and obtaining any required consent.

---

## Legal Bases (GDPR)

- **Contract.** Most processing is necessary to provide the App you requested.
- **Consent.** Special‑category (health‑related) data and marketing emails rely on your explicit consent; you can withdraw consent at any time.
- **Legitimate Interests.** Improve the App (including AI model training with anonymized data), prevent fraud/abuse, and ensure security—balanced against your rights.
- **Legal Obligation.** Where laws require record‑keeping or disclosures.

---

## AI and Third‑Party Processors

To power features, I use a small number of service providers acting on my instructions as **processors**. I share only what’s necessary to provide the App, I do **not** sell your data, and I do **not** use advertising/behavioral tracking SDKs.

- **AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google).** Your prompts (and minimal context) are sent to generate a reply. I do not include your direct contact details in prompts. Processing is subject to each provider’s terms; I do not control their systems.
- **RevenueCat (subscription management).** Processes Apple purchase receipts, manages subscription status verification, handles subscription analytics, and facilitates customer support for billing issues. I do not receive your payment card details through this service.
- **Apple / Google (auth & app stores).** Governed by their terms when you sign in or purchase.

Data may be processed in or transferred to countries outside the EU. Where this happens, I rely on appropriate safeguards and protect data in transit and at rest.

I **do not** use third‑party data for advertising or profiling, and I avoid collecting more data than necessary to operate the App.

---

## Data Sharing

- **With your direction/consent.** For future optional integrations you explicitly enable.
- **Legal requests.** Only what’s required and, if allowed, I’ll notify you.
- **Protection of rights & safety.** To enforce terms and protect users.

---

## Retention

- **Account data** is kept while your account is active. Upon deletion or prolonged inactivity, it's deleted or anonymized (subject to brief backup retention).
- **Wellness entries & chat logs.** Kept so the App works (e.g., showing your history) and deleted on account deletion or upon your request. Not used for third‑party advertising.
- **Food photos for training.** Photos used for AI model training are anonymized/de-identified and may be retained indefinitely to preserve AI model quality and accuracy, even after account deletion. This is necessary to maintain the functionality and accuracy of trained models that benefit all users.
- **Subscription & transaction records** are kept for as long as your subscription is active, plus additional time as required for customer support, dispute resolution, tax compliance, and legal obligations (typically 7 years for financial records). Apple retains its own transaction records per their policies.

---

## Your Rights (GDPR)

You can request **access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability,** and **objection** (including to marketing). You can withdraw consent at any time. To exercise rights, email **[seriouslyapp.com@gmail.com](mailto\:seriouslyapp.com@gmail.com)**. I may need to verify your identity. You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.

---

## Automated Decision‑Making

I do **not** engage in automated decision‑making that produces legal or similarly significant effects about you.

---

## Security

TLS encryption in transit, encryption at rest, access controls, least‑privilege, logging, and routine updates/monitoring. No system is 100% secure, but I take appropriate measures. If a breach affecting your data occurs, I’ll notify you and authorities as required.

---

## Children

The App is for users **16+**. I do not knowingly process data of children under 16. If you believe a child’s data was provided, contact me for deletion.

---

## International Transfers

Where data is processed outside the EU, I rely on legally appropriate safeguards and technical/organizational measures to protect your data.

---

## Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy. Material changes will be notified in‑app or via email. Continued use after the effective date signifies acceptance.
